# Py-Pass-Keeper

An offline method to store passwords/content in an encrypted way.

It uses bcrypt for password authentication and AES as Symmetric Key Encryption for encrypting the content.

I wrote this code to store some of my personal passwords, but it can be used to encrypt any piece of text.
