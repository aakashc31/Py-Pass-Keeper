1. Add logging
2. Implement GUI
3. Change filehandler. Make more robust and secure
4. Files that are written should be binary rather than text
5. Make flushing an atomic operation
6. handle wrong inputs, etc

A folder for all the data. It'll have a dictionary file to map all desc to GUID's. Every guid will be a file. 
On startup, it will check the consistency of the data folder. All guid files will only have (desc-bcrypt-cipher) in 3 lines.
In such a way, even if the dictionary file is corrupt, we can recreate it by reading all the guid files, ie, not a single point of failure. 

Later, I am planning on extending it to files.
